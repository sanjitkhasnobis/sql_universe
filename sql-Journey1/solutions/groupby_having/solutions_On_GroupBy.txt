2. For this problem please make sure to create and run the table scripts mock_data.sql
   
   select department, count(*) no_of_employees,sum(salary) sum_salary, 
   round(avg(salary),2) avg_salary, max(salary) max_salary, min(salary) min_salary
   from employees
   group by department   
   order by no_of_employees


3. select department,gender, count(*) no_of_employees,sum(salary) sum_salary, 
   round(avg(salary),2) avg_salary, max(salary) max_salary, min(salary) min_salary
   from employees
   group by department,gender   
   order by department

4. select department,count(*)
   from employees
   group by department
   having count(*) > 20

5. select count(*),first_name 
   from employees
   group by first_name
   having count(*) > 1

6. select department
   from employees
   group by department

7. select substring(email,position('@' in email)+1),count(*)
   from employees
   where email IS NOT NULL
