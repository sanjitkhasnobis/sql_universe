For solving below problems you'll first need to execute a script to load data into a table called fruit_imports. 
Then you'll have to complete a variety of aggregation query puzzles and get insight into the data.  
###################################################################################################################

1. Write a query that displays only the state with the largest amount of fruit supply.


2. Write a query that returns the most expensive cost_per_unit of every season. 
   The query should display 2 columns, the season and the cost_per_unit


3. Write a query that returns the state that has more than 1 import of the same fruit.


4. Write a query that returns the seasons that produce either 3 fruits or 4 fruits.


5. Write a query that takes into consideration the supply and cost_per_unit columns 
   for determining the total cost and returns the most expensive state with the total cost.

6. Execute the below SQL script and answer the question that follows:

CREATE table fruits (fruit_name varchar(10));
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES ('Orange');
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES ('Apple');
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES (NULL);
INSERT INTO fruits VALUES (NULL);


Write a query that returns the count of 4. You'll need to count on the column fruit_name and not use COUNT(*)
